# UnityHints.dev

Welcome to [unityhints.dev](unityhints.dev)!

I created this _Cheetsheat_ index to help Unity developers to be more productive.
Often we always fall back to the same old documentation for arguments or syntax we've forgotten.

So I made this Cheatsheet index with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted it on [Github.io](https://github.io) itself.

This project will never be completed - since there is always another or better solution around the corner.
So amnyone can contribute to this project - if you see something that's missing, you can create an **Pull Request** and hopefully it will be approved and merged into the project-
